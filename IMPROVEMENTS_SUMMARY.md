## Issues Addressed

### ✅ 1. Train/Test Representativeness Analysis (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Issue**: No study of representativeness between train/test sets

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added new method `check_train_test_representativeness()` in `CensusDataPreprocessor` class
- Compares distributions of continuous features between train and test sets
- Displays mean values and percentage differences
- Compares target variable distribution
- Location: `census_income_analysis.py` lines 292-332

**Output**:
```
TRAIN/TEST REPRESENTATIVENESS ANALYSIS
================================================================================
Comparing distributions of continuous features:
Feature                        Train Mean      Test Mean       Diff %
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
age                            34.49           34.57           0.22%
...

Target variable distribution comparison:
                 Train      Test
- 50000.        0.9379     0.9384
50000+.         0.0621     0.0616

✓ Train and test sets show similar distributions - good representativeness!
```

### ✅ 2. Feature Engineering Justification (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Issue**: No explanation for binning decisions and feature choices

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added comprehensive comments explaining rationale for each engineered feature
- Location: `census_income_analysis.py` lines 358-417

**Justifications Added**:
- **Age groups**: Based on standard demographic lifecycle stages (young adult, mid-career, pre-retirement, retirement)
- **Binary indicators**: Presence of capital gains/dividends often more predictive than amount
- **Total capital**: Net capital position provides comprehensive view of investment income
- **Work intensity**: Normalized (0-1) for easy interpretation
- **Education level**: Ordinal encoding preserves natural hierarchy
- **Native born**: Citizenship indicator for income opportunity analysis

---

### ✅ 3. Hyperparameter Coherence (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Issue**: Inconsistent max_depth values (RF=15 vs XGB/GBM=5) without explanation

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added detailed docstring explaining hyperparameter rationale
- Added console output during model initialization
- Location: `census_income_analysis.py` lines 502-562

**Explanation**:
```python
HYPERPARAMETER RATIONALE:
- Random Forest uses max_depth=15 (deeper trees) because:
  * RF uses bagging to decorrelate trees
  * Ensemble averaging reduces overfitting risk
  * Each tree sees different bootstrap sample

- Gradient Boosting and XGBoost use max_depth=5 (shallow trees) because:
  * Boosting methods work sequentially
  * Shallow "weak learners" are preferred
  * Prevents overfitting in residual learning
```

### ✅ 4. Resampling Strategy Documentation (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Issue**: No mention of resampling technique for class imbalance

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added comprehensive documentation in `train_and_evaluate()` method
- Explains decision NOT to use SMOTE/undersampling
- Location: `census_income_analysis.py` lines 564-592

**Strategy Documented**:
```
CLASS IMBALANCE STRATEGY:
Decision: We chose NOT to use resampling techniques because:
1. Large dataset size (199K samples) provides sufficient minority class examples (~12K)
2. Real-world deployment should reflect true class distribution
3. Using ROC-AUC and F1-score (both robust to class imbalance)
4. Tree-based models handle imbalance reasonably well

Alternative approaches considered:
- SMOTE: Could create synthetic samples but may introduce noise
- Undersampling: Would discard valuable majority class information
- class_weight='balanced': Could be added in future iterations
```

---

### ✅ 5. Scaling Methodology Explanation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Issue**: No explanation for choosing StandardScaler vs MinMaxScaler

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added detailed explanation in `encode_and_scale()` method
- Documented why StandardScaler is appropriate
- Explicitly highlighted data leakage prevention
- Location: `census_income_analysis.py` lines 425-484

**Rationale Added**:
```
WHY StandardScaler instead of MinMaxScaler:
1. More robust to outliers (capital gains/losses have extreme values)
2. Preserves information about outliers for tree-based models
3. Centers data around zero which helps with model convergence
4. Tree-based models are scale-invariant but benefit from standardization

CRITICAL: Fit scaler ONLY on training data to prevent data leakage
✓ No data leakage - scaler fitted on train only, transformed on test
```

---

### ✅ 6. Correlation Analysis Documentation (LOW PRIORITY)

**Issue**: Ensure clarity that Pearson correlation only used for numerical features

**Solution Implemented**:
- Updated docstring and comments to explicitly state this
- Location: `census_income_analysis.py` lines 254-276

**Comment Added**:
```python
"""Analyze correlations between continuous features (Pearson correlation only for numerical features)"""
# Calculate correlation matrix (Pearson correlation - only appropriate for continuous numerical features)
```
