- 1.62% duplicates in training set (kept to preserve population distribution)
- Clean categorical encoding needed
- Age binning proven relevant: 16.1% income rate difference across age groups

### Continuous Features
- Age: Range 0-90, mean 34.5 years
- Weeks worked: Highly bimodal (0 or 52 weeks)
- Capital gains/losses: Extremely right-skewed (most zeros)
- Dividends: Similar pattern to capital gains
